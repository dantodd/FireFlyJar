/*
This is based on the Fade tutorial available at https://www.arduino.cc/en/tutorial/fade

I changed it a ton and since I'm not really a programmer it is not optimized at all. 
I'm sure if a pro wanted to follow the same program they could make it much more elegant
But this does work, so there's that.

If you use this or redistribute it please give me a little shout out in the documentation.
